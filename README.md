# ProgramAppLibrary
This program, or UWP, is a program that will provide a graphical interface to view and use all the C# programs that I have created in my classes.

The will include the .exe and the files that will be opened when clicked on inside the app.

My goal will be to integrate the class programs into this one app for simplicity of the end user.
